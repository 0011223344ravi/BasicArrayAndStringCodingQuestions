🌳 Tree Learning Plan (Structured & Practical)
✅ Step 1: Understand What a Tree Is
Tree is a hierarchical data structure.

Root → topmost node

Child, Parent, Leaf, Subtree

Binary Tree → max 2 children per node

Binary Search Tree (BST) → left < root < right

✅ Step 2: Learn Tree Terminologies
Term	Description
Root	The top node
Leaf	Node with no children
Height	Longest path from root to leaf
Depth	Distance from root to that node
Balanced Tree	Left & right subtree heights differ ≤ 1
Full Tree	Every node has 0 or 2 children
Complete Tree	All levels filled except possibly last

✅ Step 3: Start with Tree Traversals
🔁 You must know these:

🔹 Depth-First Traversal (DFS)
Inorder → Left → Root → Right

Preorder → Root → Left → Right

Postorder → Left → Right → Root

🔹 Breadth-First Traversal (BFS)
Level order using a Queue

✅ Step 4: Core Tree Problems
Problem	Traversal/Concept
Max Depth of Tree	DFS
Invert Binary Tree	Recursion
Validate BST	Inorder + range
Lowest Common Ancestor	Recursion
Same Tree / Symmetric Tree	DFS
Diameter of Binary Tree	DFS with height

✅ Java Class Template for TreeNode
java
Copy
Edit
public class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left, right;

    TreeNode(int val) {
        this.val = val;
    }
}
