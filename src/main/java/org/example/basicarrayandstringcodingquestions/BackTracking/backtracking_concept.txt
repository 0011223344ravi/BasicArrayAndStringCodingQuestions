Awesome! 🔁✨ Backtracking is one of the most powerful and beautiful techniques in DSA — especially for solving problems involving choices, combinations, and constraints (like Sudoku, N-Queens, subsets, permutations).

🎯 What Is Backtracking?
Backtracking is a recursive technique for solving problems where we try out all possible options and "backtrack" if a solution doesn’t work.

It’s like:
Try ➡️ Fail ➡️ Undo ➡️ Try Next

✅ Core Idea:
Choose

Explore (recursively)

Undo (backtrack)

void backtrack(parameters) {
    if (base condition is met) {
        add result;
        return;
    }

    for (choice in all possible choices) {
        make a choice;
        backtrack(...);      // explore
        undo the choice;     // backtrack
    }
}
